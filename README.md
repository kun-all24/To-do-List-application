# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React To-Do List Project

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It helps users manage their tasks efficiently by allowing them to add, view, and delete to-do items.

---

## Features

- Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- View all tasks in an organized layout.
- Mark tasks as completed or delete them.
- Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple files for better code management:

- **`Header.jsx`**: Displays the application's header.
- **`TodoItem.jsx`**: Represents an individual to-do item.
- **`TodoList.jsx`**: Manages and displays the list of tasks.
- **`App.jsx`**: The root component where all components are combined.
- **`index.css`**: Custom styling for the project.
